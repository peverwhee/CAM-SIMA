! generally, analytic_ic runs do not need a topo file (see namelist_definition_cam.xml)
! however, a topo file needs to be supplied to run the Beta Ridge gravity wave scheme.
!
! in the future, the FCAM7 test can be migrated to using 'real' initial conditions,
! and this line can be removed, and
! analytic ic runs can go back to having no topo file supplied as it is by default.
