Subject: [PATCH] Disable physics for MPAS dycore-only build

When building MPAS as a dycore, all physics-related components are disabled.
This build configuration is usually used by CAM/CAM-SIMA, and can be achieved by
defining the `MPAS_CAM_DYCORE` macro in `CPPFLAGS`.

The `PHYSICS` variable controls whether physics are enabled in MPAS, but its logic
is decoupled from the `MPAS_CAM_DYCORE` macro. Disabling physics in MPAS currently
requires manual interventions.

Therefore, automatically disable physics when the `MPAS_CAM_DYCORE` macro is found
in `CPPFLAGS`.

This downstream patch is maintained by CAM-SIMA for its particular use case of MPAS.
